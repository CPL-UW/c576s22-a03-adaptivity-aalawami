Sorry I didn't do this sooner //_//

Made it so that random pieces only appear if 40% of horizontal lines are empty, if score is low and the 75% of horizontal lines are full makes new pieces 3 tiles instead of 4, also implemented a free line kill feature.

# CS576-Tetris-Sample

1. Clone this repo
2. Open it in a 2021 version of Unity
3. 2xClick TetrisScene (in Assets/Scenes)
4. Hit run?

Apologies for the mess. YMMV.
